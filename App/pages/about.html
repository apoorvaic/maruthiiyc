            <h4> Introduction: </h4>
            
              <small>  I'm a 32 year old Indian citizen born, raised in Devanahalli, Bengaluru Rural, Karnataka. I come from an agricultural background, my father Late Sri Sriramaiah was a farmer and my mother Smt Lalithamma a home maker. 
            </small> </span></span>
                <small>I embarked upon my journey in the public domain way back in 2002 during my school days. Prior to this, I was closely following the political leaders, their thoughts, actions through newspapers, elections, public gatherings with my father. What did strike me was these leaders' passion working for people, political party, their willingness to help common man and their engagement. This invigorated me, since then has been my life and interest as I believe this is one of the paths to provide social justice to all. 
</small> </span></span>
               <small> The leadership, sacrifice, contributions of the Nehru-Gandhi family in particular, the Congress party in general for Independent India without bias/caste/creed, to serve the people, give common man an opportunity to participate in the decision making, democracy made me to join Congress party as the obvious choice. 
</small> </span></span>
                
              <small>  I did get an opportunity to contest in the elections for Indian Youth Congress where I became IYC Chikballapura Loksabha president in the year 2014 till date. I call this a common man's frame work. Looking back into my short journey so far, I believe the success of a village, a state, a nation is due to the great leaders, their choices, actions and decisions. 
                  
            Jai Hind!
